# SPACE INVADERS.

This is my first working version of the final project of the course [How to Code - Simple Data](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+HtC1x+2T2017/home).

## HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM.

- Load the file in [DrRacket](https://racket-lang.org/).
- Start the program with `(main G0)`.

## BUGS.

I haven't figured how to use `check-random` properly, because of this, sometimes 2 or 3 tests will fail (the ones where it checks the invaders moved, indeed the invaders moved but depending on if a new invader was generated, the tests will fail).

There is room for refactoring. Some functions seems to be repetitive.
